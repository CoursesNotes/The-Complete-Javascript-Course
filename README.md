## AJAX and APIS 

**What are AJAX and APIS ?**

  #### AJAX
   - Stands for Asynchronous Javascript and XML 
   - Allows us to communicate with Asynchronous Servers
   
   
  #### API
   - Stands for Application Programming Interface
   - On a very high level is basically a piece of software that can be use by another piece of software in order to allow applications to talk with each others.
   - An API is not a Server itself but a part of the Server, an application which receives a requests and sends back responses. 
   - There are 2 types of API's that you can use in Javascript: 
   
          1. Your own API, for data coming from your own server
          2. 3-rd Party API's: 
                - Google Maps
                - Embedded Youtube Videos
                - Weather Data
                - Movies Data
                - Send email or SMS
